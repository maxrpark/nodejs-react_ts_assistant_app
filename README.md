## Assistant Apps

This project is part of Assitant Apps Projects

The idea of Assistant Apps is to create the same app using different languages or frameworks.

I hope, I keep learning new onces in the future so this project expects more and more.

## Node.js Backend

The backend of this project was built using Express and hosted on heroku.

For the frontend I used React and Typescript and it is deployed on Netlify.
